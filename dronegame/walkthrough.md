# Drone Game

## Overview

For KubeCon NA 23, the team at [Synadia](https://www.synadia.com/) wanted to build something that pushed NATS to the limits and stunned the audience. So we built an augmented reality drone game for mobile devices! The game is played in a web browser and uses a 3D scene to show the drones and bullets. As users play the game, millions of data points are collected and stored both in NATS and a database. We use every part of NATS (Core, Jetstream, KV, Object Store) to build the game data. For things that weren't a good fit (user ranking queries) we use embedded SQLite.

To play the game, just grab your phone or tablet and head over to https://dronegame.io.

You will be asked for permissions to allow access to the sensors and once you've done that, tilt and pan your phone to scope the flying drones, then tap the screen to shoot. At the end of the round, your data will be viewable, and you have the option of logging your score on the leaderboard.

For this general release, we've removed the camera requirementâ€“and thus the AR aspect. The drones appear in an arena, instead of around you. This makes people less suspicious we're doing anything questionable, without detracting from the game itself.

## Sequence Flow

### Match begins

Route: `/matches/new`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant wc as 3D WebComponent
    participant b as Browser
    participant be as Backend
    participant db as SQLite
    participant js as NATS Jetstream Match Events
    participant kv as NATS KV Match State

    b->>be: Initial Page Load
    be->>b: Page with 3D WebComponent & Datastar with match data
    wc-->>b: Load 3D Scene
    wc->>be: POST protobuf sensor data (rotation, clicks)
    par
        be->>kv: Store current match state
        be->>js: Publish events from sensors + start/end/hit
        be->>db: Insert score data into Leaderboard
    end
    wc->>be: Redirect when match ends to /matches/{matchId}
```

### Match details

Route: `/matches/{matchId}`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant wc as 3D WebComponent
    participant b as Browser
    participant be as Backend
    participant os as NATS Object Store Match Cache

    b->>be: Initial Page Load
    be-->>b: Page with 3D WebComponent & Datastar
    wc->>b: Load 3D Scene
    wc->>be: GET protobuf match data
    be->>os: Upsert match cache from match event stream
    os-->>wc: Send match objects (drones, bullets, etc)
    wc->>wc: Create animation keyframes, optimize 3D scene
    wc->>b: Report stats via Datastar to other parts of the page
```

#### Details

The match details page will show the match data and the 3D scene. The 3D can get large so there is an optimization step to reduce the number of animation keyframes.

### Match live

Route: `/matches/live`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant wc as 3D WebComponent
    participant b as Browser
    participant be as Backend
    participant js as NATS Jetstream Match Events


    b->>be: Initial Page Load
    be-->>b: Page with 3D WebComponent & Datastar
    wc->>b: Load 3D Scene
    b->>be: Start GET /matches/live/datapoints SSE connection
    be->>js: Subcribe to live data points
    js-->>b: Send live data points as signal patches (base64 encoded strings)
    b-->>wc: Update 3D scene with signal patches (b64 -> protobuf)
```

#### Details

Multiple matches can be live at the same time. The backend will show the latest data points for a match unless it stops sending data for N seconds, then it will pick the next match message as the current one.

### Leaderboard

Route: `/leaderboards/daily`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant b as Browser
    participant be as Backend
    participant kv as NATS KV Match State
    participant db as SQLite

    b->>be: Initial Page Load
    be-->>b: Page with Datastar
    b->>be: GET /leaderboards/daily SSE connection
    be->>kv: Subscribe to leaderboard data changes
    kv->>db: Watched matches query DB
    db-->>b: Return leaderboard data via SSE
```
